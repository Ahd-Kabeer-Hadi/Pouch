## Getting Started

To begin, start the development server by running:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Then, open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) in your browser to view the application.

You can start modifying the page by editing `app/page.tsx`. Changes you make will automatically reflect in the browser.

To create [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/router-handlers), add an `api/` directory within the `app/` directory and include a `route.ts` file. For individual endpoints, create a subfolder in the `api` directory. For instance, `api/hello/route.ts` would map to [http://localhost:3001/api/hello](http://localhost:3001/api/hello).
